## Intro
I created a simple messaging application that allows users to enter a chat room and have text conversations. This application allows people to send their location, take pictures, and send images to the chat. They are also able to log in anonymously and create their own username and color for use in the application. 

## Features:
The application was made to be able to do the following: 
    * Select a personailized background for use with the application.
    * Sign-in with a username.
    * Send and receive messages in real time. 
    * Images and location can be shared.
    * Offline viewing of the messages.

    * AsyncStorage (for offline usage)
